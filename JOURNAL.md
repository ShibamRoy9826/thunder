### Time spent : 2-3 hrs

Brainstormed my project, its going to be an **FPV RC car** so that I can race around my home, I am honestly really excited to build this thing, I have always wanted to make something like this.
Also did a lot of research on RC cars, saw other RC cars, and ton of yt vids and got an idea on where to start.

Made a rough circuit diagram, might be incorrect tbh, still continuing my research. Also did some testing in tinkercad.
So far learned about ESCs & BECs(which, if I am not wrong, are built-in most ESCs) though I couldn't find them in any simulator as a component, so ig for simulation I have to make my own ESC and BEC. 

I also made a roadmap kind of thing so that I know what I need to do after each step.
I plan to learn about some parts first, select which ones to use in my project and then start designing the chassis, once I am done with the chassis model,I want to work on the PCB designing part, and finally the outer 3d model.

( _I plan to use ESP-32s, but as I am just testing, I think arduino would work just fine..._ )

### Time spent : ~ 3 

I did some of research on transmitters and receivers which I think would be the hardest part in this project. I initially thought of using ESP32s but I think using 2 microcontrollers for this just doesn't make sense, atleast not when I can do it without microcontrollers + They would limit the range by a lot. 

I am thinking of going with a 5.8Ghz , 4-5-channel trasmitter and receiver(I would be using just 3 of them but would keep some incase of future extension of the project). I would be using one channel for steering, one for throttle and the last for headlights. To make this project cooler, I would make the transmitter and receiver myself!

I already started a project in kicad, did nothing till now, currently finding symbols and footprints

I would be using an overall schematic similar to this that I found on the internet, I honestly don't know a lot about all components yet, so I would only place stuff in kicad when I know what it does.
