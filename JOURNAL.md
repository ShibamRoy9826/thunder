Brainstormed my project, its going to be an **FPV RC car** so that I can race around my home, I am honestly really excited to build this thing, I have always wanted to make something like this.
Also did a lot of research on RC cars, saw other RC cars, and ton of yt vids and got an idea on where to start.

Made a rough circuit diagram, might be incorrect tbh, still continuing my research. Also did some testing in tinkercad.
So far learned about ESCs & BECs(which, if I am not wrong, are built-in most ESCs) though I couldn't find them in any simulator as a component, so ig for simulation I have to make my own ESC and BEC. 

I also made a roadmap kind of thing so that I know what I need to do after each step.
I plan to learn about some parts first, select which ones to use in my project and then start designing the chassis, once I am done with the chassis model,I want to work on the PCB designing part, and finally the outer 3d model.

( _I plan to use ESP-32s, but as I am just testing, I think arduino would work just fine..._ )
